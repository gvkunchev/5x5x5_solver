# An ugly but working 5x5x5 puzzle solver

A script made long long long time ago in аn accommodation far far away (ж.к Младост), aiming to solve a puzzle that is impossible to solve without computer help. See puzzle.png for the puzzle itself.

Run pustinqk.py and wait a couple of days to start producing solutions.

The script will try to collect all possible solutions, which I believe was somewhere about 1000, if I remeber correctly.
